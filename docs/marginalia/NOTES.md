# Marginalia — Notes

Running log of spec gaps, friction, and blockers found during implementation.
Append; don't rewrite history.

## Spec gaps

- **2026-07-11 (M0):** SPEC calls for Node 22+, but the dev machine has Node
  20.19.4 (homebrew `node@20`), and `corepack prepare pnpm@latest` fails on it
  (`ERR_VM_DYNAMIC_IMPORT_CALLBACK_MISSING` — pnpm 11 requires a newer Node).
  Pinned `pnpm@9` via `corepack prepare pnpm@9 --activate`, which works fine
  on Node 20. Nothing in the stack (Express 5, better-sqlite3, Vite, React 18)
  needs Node 22-specific features. `package.json` engines field set to
  `>=20` instead of `>=22`. Revisit if the runtime machine gets Node 22+.
- **2026-07-11 (M0):** `tsconfig.base.json` originally also set
  `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (stricter than
  SPEC's plain "strict mode" requirement). This broke on Vite's CSS Modules
  typing (`styles.brand` becomes `string | undefined` under
  `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` because `vite/client`'s `CSSModuleClasses` type
  is an index signature) — every CSS-module class reference in the web
  package would need `!` or a guard. Removed both flags, kept `strict: true`.

## Friction

- **2026-07-16 (M2):** epub.js's `ePub(url)` sniffs input type from the URL's
  file extension; our file route (`/api/resources/:id/file`) has none, so it
  defaulted to treating the URL as an unpacked directory of book files
  (fetching `META-INF/container.xml` etc. as separate relative requests →
  404s) instead of a single archive to fetch-and-unzip. Fixed by passing
  `{ openAs: "epub" }` in the `ePub()` options.
- **2026-07-16 (M2):** epub.js's paginated flow renders each section into one
  wide multi-column iframe and reveals the current page via the *container's*
  scroll offset — the iframe itself is far wider than the visible viewport
  and is positioned off to the side. A forwarded content `click` event's
  `clientX`/`contents.window.innerWidth` are relative to that whole wide
  canvas, not the visible page, so naive click-zone math (`clientX < width *
  0.3`) silently never triggers. Fixed by translating through the iframe
  element's own `getBoundingClientRect()` (via `contents.document.defaultView
  .frameElement`) relative to our container's rect. Verified concretely with
  a headless-browser click at a known screen position and confirming the
  saved CFI position actually advanced/retreated — don't trust a fix here
  without checking the real epub.js DOM structure (`.epub-container` >
  `.epub-view` > `iframe`).
- **2026-07-16 (M2):** the Standard Ebooks/Gutenberg-derived Alice fixture has
  an unclosed `<a id="chap01">` bookmark anchor (no `href`) at the top of each
  chapter; lenient HTML parsing makes it swallow the entire chapter body as
  its descendant. A naive "don't turn pages when the click target is inside
  an `<a>`" guard (meant to let real hyperlinks work) matched on every single
  click in the whole book. Fixed by checking `closest("a[href]")` instead of
  `closest("a")` — only navigable links should suppress the page-turn.
- **2026-07-17 (M3):** epub.js's paginated flow shows only ~1 "logical page"
  of a chapter-length spine section at a time, but the *whole section* is one
  DOM document — `document.querySelector`/`TreeWalker` can happily find and
  select text that exists in the DOM but is scrolled off the currently
  visible page. A scripted test selection that didn't check the resulting
  Range's `getBoundingClientRect()` against the viewport produced a
  wildly-offscreen Ask pill position that looked like a coordinate-math bug
  but wasn't — real users can only ever drag-select visible pixels, so this
  can't happen via genuine interaction. Worth remembering when testing
  anything selection-related against epub.js: always verify the selected
  Range is actually within the visible viewport first.
- **2026-07-17 (M3):** epub.js renders highlight/annotation marks via a
  separate SVG "marks-pane" overlay positioned over the iframe *in the parent
  document*, not as elements inside the iframe's own DOM — querying for
  `.marginalia-highlight` (or any annotation class) has to search the
  top-level page, not the iframe's document.
- **2026-07-17 (M3):** the margin rail's hover-revealed delete button
  (`opacity: 0` by default) still intercepted clicks meant for the dot
  underneath it, because `opacity` doesn't affect hit-testing — needed
  `pointer-events: none` until hovered. Separately, since hovering the dot to
  click it *also* triggers the wrapper's `:hover`, an overlapping delete
  button (`inset: -0.5rem`) would reveal itself and eat that same click. Fixed
  by moving the delete button to sit beside the dot instead of on top of it.

- **2026-07-17 (M4):** `@anthropic-ai/sdk`'s `zodOutputFormat()` helper (used
  by `messages.parse` for structured extraction) requires a **zod/v4**
  schema instance (`import { z } from "zod/v4"`), not the classic
  `import { z } from "zod"` (v3-shaped `ZodType<Output, Def, Input>`) used
  everywhere else in this codebase for the HTTP boundary schemas in
  `shared/`. The installed `zod` (3.25.76) actually ships both — `.`
  resolves to the classic v3 API, `./v4` to the new one — so this compiles
  as two structurally different `ZodType` types, not just a version bump.
  `LLMProvider.extract()`'s `schema` param is typed against `zod/v4`
  specifically (see the comment in `llm/provider.ts`); **M6's vault-compiler
  concept-extraction schema must be built with `zod/v4`**, not the classic
  import other shared schemas use. `OpenAICompatProvider.extract()` is
  unaffected — it only calls `.safeParse()`, which exists on both zod
  versions' `ZodType` with the same shape.

- **2026-07-17 (M5):** `req.on("close")` is **useless** for detecting a
  client disconnect on a long-lived SSE response in Express/Node — it fires
  as soon as the *request* body has finished being read (i.e. right after
  `express.json()` parses it), not when the client actually goes away. In
  `routes/threads.ts` this meant the abort `AbortController` fired almost
  immediately after `res.flushHeaders()`, aborting the provider's `fetch()`
  before it could ever return — every thread request hung forever with zero
  bytes streamed, no error logged anywhere (the abort happened, but nothing
  after it ran because the client's connection was never actually closed,
  so nothing observed the failure). Took a long debugging detour: identical
  code (same `OpenAICompatProvider`, same book-sized context, same
  `AbortController` wiring) worked instantly in a one-off script and in a
  scratch Express app, and only hung inside the *real* running dev server —
  the actual variable was `req.on("close")` vs `res.on("close")`, not
  anything about context size, keep-alive, or process state (all dead ends
  chased first). **Fix:** listen on `res.on("close")` instead (fires when
  the *response's* underlying connection ends) and guard with
  `if (res.writableEnded) return;` so our own clean `res.end()` doesn't look
  like a disconnect. Verified against a real streaming SSE call end-to-end
  (first question, a follow-up, `GET /api/threads/:id`, and the
  highlights-with-thread-summary listing) once fixed.
- **2026-07-17 (M5):** `ThreadPanel`'s history-load effect originally
  depended on `thread?.id`. Since the panel receives its `thread` prop from
  the parent's highlight list, and `onThreadChange` updates that same list
  the moment a *new* thread's first message finishes streaming, `thread?.id`
  flips from `undefined` to a real id purely as a side effect of our own
  `onDone` callback — re-triggering the effect and firing a redundant
  `GET /api/threads/:id` right after every first message (harmless — same
  content — but wasteful, and confusing to read a network log of). Fixed by
  capturing the thread prop once at mount (`useState(() => thread)`, never
  updated) and keying the history-load effect off that instead; `submit()`
  still reads the live `thread` prop reactively to target follow-ups at the
  right URL. Caught by watching the network log during browser verification,
  not by a test.
- **2026-07-17 (M4/M5):** Two `fetch("/api/settings")` call sites
  (`SettingsPage.tsx`, `ReaderView.tsx`) were missing a `.catch()`/try-catch
  around the initial mount fetch — surfaced as an actual unhandled promise
  rejection in the web vitest run (jsdom has no base URL for relative
  fetches), which would equally be an unhandled rejection in a real browser
  if the request ever failed (offline, server restarting). Both wrapped in
  try/catch now, matching the pattern `LibraryPage.tsx` already used.

## Session handoff — 2026-07-13 (M1 in progress, nothing committed)

> **SUPERSEDED** by the review section below — everything in this handoff was
> subsequently run, verified, and committed as M1. Kept for history only.

Picking up in a fresh chat window. Everything below is **uncommitted**, on top
of commit `f4e7b9d` (M0). The session was interrupted mid-task, right before
running the server test suite for the first time against this new code — so
**none of it has been run or verified yet**. Do that first.

`git status` at handoff time:

```
 M projects/marginalia/pnpm-lock.yaml
 M projects/marginalia/server/package.json
 M projects/marginalia/server/src/index.ts
 M projects/marginalia/web/src/library/LibraryPage.module.css
 M projects/marginalia/web/src/library/LibraryPage.tsx
?? projects/marginalia/server/src/library/
?? projects/marginalia/server/src/routes/
```

### What's implemented (per TASKS.md M1)

- **`server/src/library/epub.ts`** — `extractEpub(buffer)`: reads
  `META-INF/container.xml` → OPF rootfile path → parses the OPF
  (`dc:title`, first `dc:creator` as author, `dc:language`, `dc:publisher`,
  cover `<meta name="cover">`) → resolves manifest `href`s relative to the
  OPF's directory → walks `<spine>` `itemref`s in document order → converts
  each spine item's (X)HTML body to plain text via `htmlToText` (now
  exported for direct unit testing). Uses `htmlparser2` in `xmlMode: true`
  for container.xml/OPF (exact tag/attr casing), default HTML mode for spine
  content (more tolerant of malformed markup). `<head>`/`<script>`/`<style>`
  content is excluded from extracted text via a `skipDepth` counter, so
  `<head><title>` text can't leak into the book text. Confirmed empirically
  that `htmlparser2` v9 decodes HTML entities automatically with no
  `decodeEntities` option needed (tested via a one-off `node -e` snippet
  against `café — "hello" & <tag> é '` before writing this).
- **`server/src/library/store.ts`** — `getResourceById`,
  `getResourceFilePath`, `listResourceSummaries` (join subqueries for
  `highlight_count`/`thread_count`). Handles the snake_case DB row →
  camelCase `Resource`/`ResourceSummary` mapping and `metadata` JSON
  parse/stringify.
- **`server/src/library/importResource.ts`** — `importEpub(db, buffer)`:
  sha256 hash → `getResourceById` short-circuit (this is the dedupe: a
  re-import of identical bytes returns the existing row, no re-extraction,
  no re-write) → `extractEpub` → write `LIBRARY_DIR/<hash>.epub` → a
  `db.transaction` inserting the `resources` row + all `resource_text` rows
  → on transaction failure, deletes the just-written file so we don't leave
  an orphaned file with no DB row.
- **`server/src/routes/resources.ts`** — `POST /` (multer
  `memoryStorage()`, field name `"file"`, 200MB limit, rejects non-`.epub`
  originalname with 400), `GET /` (list summaries), `GET /:id`,
  `GET /:id/file` (`res.sendFile` with `application/epub+zip`). Wired into
  `server/src/index.ts` as `app.use("/api/resources", resourcesRouter)`
  (that one-line addition is the `index.ts` diff above).
- **`server/src/library/epub.test.ts`** — vitest against the two real
  fixtures (`fixtures/alice-in-wonderland.epub`,
  `fixtures/metamorphosis.epub`, both already committed in M0): title/
  author/language, exact spine counts (14 for Alice, 5 for Metamorphosis),
  non-empty text on every spine item except the image-only cover wrapper
  (spine index 0), a "White Rabbit" content spot-check, and a determinism
  check (`extractEpub` called twice on the same buffer → `toEqual`). A
  `describe("htmlToText")` block was added on top of my version (see below)
  with focused tests for head/title stripping, script/style stripping, and
  block-tag newline insertion.
- **`server/package.json`** — added `adm-zip`, `htmlparser2`,
  `multer@^2.2.0` + matching `@types/*`. Deliberately **not** multer 1.x —
  checked `npm view multer dist-tags`: 1.x is the deprecated/CVE'd line,
  2.2.0 is current `latest`. `@types/multer@^2.2.0` matches. Already ran
  `pnpm install` once for these — `pnpm-lock.yaml`'s diff reflects it — but
  re-run it again first thing in the new session as a safety net.
- **`web/src/library/LibraryPage.tsx` + `.module.css`** — these were
  rewritten **after my last edit, by the user or a linter** (flagged via
  system-reminders mid-session, I did not author the final version and
  haven't reviewed the `.module.css` at all). The `.tsx` now has: real
  `GET /api/resources` fetch on mount, drag-drop with a `dragDepth` ref
  counter (so nested drag-enter/leave of child elements don't flicker the
  dropzone state), a hidden file `<input>` + "Import book"/"Choose a file"
  buttons, per-file `XMLHttpRequest` upload with a real progress bar
  (`xhr.upload.onprogress`), per-upload error state with a dismiss button,
  client-side `.epub` extension rejection before upload, a library grid of
  cards (title/author/highlight count) linking to `/read/:id`, and the
  original designed empty state preserved when there are zero resources.
  **Read this file fresh in the new session** rather than trusting this
  summary — I only have it via a diff snippet, not a full read.

### Not yet done — do these in order

1. `cd projects/marginalia && pnpm install` (pick up the two new server deps
   cleanly in a fresh shell).
2. `pnpm --filter @marginalia/server test` — this exact command was queued
   and interrupted. Run it first; fix whatever `epub.test.ts` reveals.
3. `pnpm build` (full workspace `tsc -b`) — first real compile of
   `resources.ts` against multer 2.x + Express 5's types; this combination
   has never been compiled or exercised, it's the highest-risk untested
   integration point in this batch of work.
4. `pnpm test` (all three packages).
5. Manual **Verify** step from TASKS.md M1: `pnpm dev`, drag-drop both
   fixture EPUBs into the library UI (or a headless-browser pass, same
   approach used for the M0 verification — see that commit's description),
   confirm both appear in the grid, confirm re-importing one is a no-op
   (no duplicate row — check via `sqlite3 data/marginalia.sqlite`), confirm
   `resource_text` rows exist for both books.
6. Only after (5) passes: check the M1 boxes in `docs/marginalia/TASKS.md`.
7. Commit M1 (small, focused — extraction/store/import/routes as one
   commit and the library UI as another is reasonable, or bundle if that
   feels like unnecessary ceremony; use judgment).
8. Continue to M2 (Reader / epub.js wrapper) per TASKS.md.

### Specific things to double-check (uncertain / unverified at handoff)

- `htmlToText` is now `export`ed from `epub.ts` (added to satisfy the new
  `describe("htmlToText")` test block) — confirm the export is actually
  there and the function body wasn't otherwise changed by whoever edited
  the test file.
- `attribs.id`/`attribs.href`/etc. from `htmlparser2`'s `onopentag` are
  typed as plain `string` (not `string | undefined`) since M0 dropped
  `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` — the code relies on truthy checks
  (`attribs.id && attribs.href`), which is correct at runtime, but it means
  `tsc` won't catch a missing-attribute bug here. Not a blocker, just don't
  assume the type signature is protecting you in this one module.
- `res.sendFile(filePath)` in `GET /:id/file` needs an **absolute** path —
  `LIBRARY_DIR` should already be absolute (built from `path.resolve` in
  `server/src/paths.ts`, from M0), but confirm rather than assume.
- Multer 2.x + Express 5 `RequestHandler` typing has never actually been
  compiled — see item 3 above.

### Standing process reminder (from SONNET_PROMPT.md)

Read CLAUDE.md → SPEC.md → TASKS.md → PRODUCT.md if this is a genuinely
fresh context. Do the next unchecked TASKS.md item. Verify each milestone
for real (drive the app), not just via tests. Don't re-decide settled
decisions. Log new SPEC-GAPs/friction/blockers here. Small, focused commits
with the relevant TASKS.md boxes checked in the same commit.

## Senior review + M1 sign-off — 2026-07-13 (Fable)

Reviewed all M1 code (`epub.ts`, `store.ts`, `importResource.ts`,
`routes/resources.ts`, `LibraryPage.tsx` + css) and ran the full verification
that the interrupted session left queued. **Everything passed; M1 is done and
committed.** Verified concretely:

- `pnpm install` / `pnpm build` (full `tsc -b`, incl. multer 2.x + Express 5
  types — the flagged risk compiled clean) / `pnpm test` — 12/12 green.
- API drive: imported both fixtures via `curl` multipart → correct
  title/author/metadata; re-import returned the identical resource (dedupe);
  sqlite shows 2 `resources` rows, 14 + 5 `resource_text` rows; both
  content-addressed files in `data/library/`; `GET /:id/file` → 200
  `application/epub+zip`; non-epub upload → 400 `unsupported_format`.
- UI drive (headless chromium against `pnpm dev`): grid renders both books,
  re-import via the file input leaves 2 cards, a `.txt` shows the inline
  dismissible error, screenshot looks right in the paper theme.
- The `LibraryPage.tsx` the previous session hadn't reviewed: read in full,
  no issues. `htmlToText` export is present and unchanged.

Code-review notes (no action needed, recorded for awareness):

- `parseOpf` captures only the *first* `dc:creator` — intentional per the
  handoff; multi-author books lose co-authors. Fine for now.
- `POST /api/resources` returns 422 with the raw `Error.message` for any
  import failure — acceptable locally, don't cargo-cult this pattern into
  LLM routes where messages may contain provider details.
- `importEpub` writes the file before the DB transaction and removes it on
  failure — correct ordering, leave as is.

**Next task: M2 — Reader** (first unchecked box in TASKS.md). No open
blockers. Standing process in SONNET_PROMPT.md still applies verbatim.
