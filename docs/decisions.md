# Decisions

Short, dated entries. Newest first. Amend CLAUDE.md's "Settled decisions" when one of
these changes the rules.

## 2026-07-17 — Provider strategy: subscription OAuth & endpoint presets
- Target provider lineup (long-term): Anthropic API key, OpenAI-compatible endpoints
  (OpenRouter, local Ollama/LM Studio, any Bearer-token bridge incl. a future
  ChatGPT/Hermes OAuth endpoint), and Anthropic **subscription** access.
- OpenRouter and local models need no new code — they are `openaiCompat` with different
  base URLs. Settings UI should offer base-URL presets (OpenRouter / Ollama / LM Studio /
  Custom).
- Subscription-credit access to Claude (Pro/Max instead of per-token API billing) goes
  through the Claude Agent SDK, which inherits the local Claude Code login
  (`claude setup-token` for a long-lived token). That is a **third LLMProvider
  implementation** (`claudeAgent.ts`), deferred past M4 — the seam absorbs it without
  touching threads/context/UI. Raw Messages API with an sk- key stays the M4 Anthropic
  implementation.
- ChatGPT-subscription OAuth: build nothing now; if/when a usable endpoint exists it
  should enter through `openaiCompat` (base URL + Bearer token), with a token-refresh
  helper only if needed.
- No sign-in required to use the app: M5's unconfigured-provider nudge is the designed
  state until a provider is configured.

## 2026-07-17 — Three-room design system (v1.5 direction)
- The app is three "rooms" with distinct materials joined by continuous doorway
  transitions: the Desk (freeform bookshelf, warm/tactile), the Book (reader,
  analogue paper/ink, effects-free), the Scan (timeline heat map, CRT/retrofuturist).
  Full blueprint: docs/marginalia/DESIGN.md.
- v1 scope unchanged: M4–M7 land first, exactly per SPEC; rooms are M8–M10.
- Motion library is `motion` (framer-motion successor); no three.js/WebGL unless a
  named effect (M10 page curl) proves to need it; everything gates on
  prefers-reduced-motion.
- epub.js stays. 3D page turns are snapshot-based over its iframe (no per-page DOM
  exists to peel); a custom paginator is the escape hatch behind the ResourceRenderer
  seam, only if snapshots prove insufficient.
- Reader effects budget: cursor trails/parallax/glow live on the Desk and Scan only —
  never in the reader ("reading comes first").

## 2026-07-10 — Founding decisions (Marginalia)
- Provider-agnostic LLM layer; "LLM proposes, code disposes" — model never touches files.
- EPUB first; PDF/Markdown deferred.
- Node server + browser UI; native shell (Tauri/Electron) deferred until product proven.
- Immutable-on-import, content-addressed library → anchors can't rot.
- SQLite sidecar is source of truth; Obsidian vault is a one-way compiled projection.
- Vault gets distilled concept notes, not raw transcripts.
- Whole-resource context by default, with provider-side caching where available.
